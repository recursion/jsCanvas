jsCanvas
========

Some simple javascript canvas interactions. Mainly tinkering with the HTML5 canvas options in an attempt to better understand them.

So far:
The canvas resizes to the screen size its being displayed in.
The game takes player input in the form of wasd and space keys.
It draws a square to the screen representing the player
Keeps player from moving outside the bounds of the screen.
